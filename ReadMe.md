### A program that simplifies organizing The Loony Tunes collection so that you can easily view it on plex. The Disk order is not recognized by plex, nor is the absolute order.

### The spelling and punctuation must match what is in the list. If they do not match they will not be found, capitalization does not matter

## How to use
### There are two variables one on line 36 and one on 37 which need to be changed inorder for the program to work. One is for unsorted files, and the other is for the new destination
### The root folder Looney Tunes will not be created, file extension will be maintained, EX: .mp4, .mov, .mkv etc.

## Future development 
### Currently it only sorts episodes from 1929 to 1980, I would like to get all seasons on thetvdb.com
### Instead of hard coding the sources ask in command line
### Create a .exe, .app, and linux program
